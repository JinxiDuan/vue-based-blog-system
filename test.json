          "raw": "# title1 Amazon should recognize its first unionized warehouse in the U.S., a federal labor official has ruled, rejecting the company's bid to unravel a breakthrough union win on Staten Island.\n\nOn Wednesday, the National Labor Relations Board's Region 28 regional director, Cornele Overstreet, dismissed Amazon's allegations that labor-board officers and union organizers improperly influenced the union vote. In the spring, the upstart Amazon Labor Union won the right to represent some 8,000 workers at the massive New York warehouse.\n\nAmazon is expected to appeal the Jan. 11 ruling before the full board in Washington, D.C. But labor experts say board members are likely to side with their regional colleagues. That would certify the union's win and require Amazon to begin bargaining \"in good faith\" with the union, or they can request a review of the decision by Jan. 25. If the company refuses, the case would likely make its way into courts.",
